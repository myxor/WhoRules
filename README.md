# WhoRules

This app serves as a simplification for the implementation of a concept which has been created and developed in our men's vacation.

I would like to briefly describe this concept:

## The concept

__First of all: one is always king - exactly one.__

King? Why is one the king?

Well, in principle, it is difficult to make decisions together with several people on holiday with whom everyone always agrees - right?
For this problem the king principle was developed.

Every two hours during the vacation, one of the group is designated as a king by a random generator.
This then has the sole power of determination over all in the group. He may decide what to do, what we eat and above all what is drunk.
Of course, there are limitations in his power: all decisions must be consistent with local law and human dignity.

Everyone else in the group must submit to the king and always address him with the correct title.

When the two hours of regency are over, the next regent is determined by random.

## Is one always king?

Not really.

If someone has governed five full terms during a vacation, then he has the honor to move up to the next rank.

The current ranks are in ascending order:
(The ranks are in german)

* Freiherr
* Graf
* Fürst
* Herzog
* König
* Kaiser
* Imperator
* Pharao
* Halbgott
* Gott

## What is this app good for?

This app helps enforce this principle.

The following features are implemented:

* Determine regents by chance
* List of past regencies
* Manage list of vacation participants
* Automatic transport
* Notification on carriage
* Drink timer


# Note

This project was born out of pure fun and should be considered as such.
Nevertheless, I would be happy if anyone considers this fun oder even useful in any way. 

Please also note that still a lot of strings are hardcoded in german language in the code. 
I hope that i can someday move these to translation files.
